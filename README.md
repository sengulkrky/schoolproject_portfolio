## School Project Portfolio
This project is a simple website I created last year for school. The site serves as a portfolio containing an overview of all lab assignments we completed during the school year. Each lab includes a short explanation and the corresponding solution. 

The project is intented as practice in web development and documentation, and mainly illustrates my progress throughout the course.
